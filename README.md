# nix-MacBookAir

My M1 MacBook Air's nix config.

Currently, I haven't done much on the system after wiping outside of this config.

For completion, here are the things I've done that aren't in my nix conf:

+ Clicked through the setup & ctre
+ Connected to my Wi-Fi
+ Created my local user (alex)
+ Added my ssh keys
+ Removed a bunch of extra stuff from the dock
+ Rosetta
+ Enabled Japanese IME support

I'm installing ".app's" through [brew casks](https://daiderd.com/nix-darwin/manual/index.html#opt-homebrew.casks).
